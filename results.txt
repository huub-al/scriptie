    forward with H + 1 column (hyperedge to predict)
    prediction head with input dimension 2 * 768, learned hyperedge representations
    + original embedding.   
    Epoch 15/15, Average Loss: 0.3587
    - Pretty good, maybe to reliant on original embedding.

    forward with H + 1 column (hyperedge to predict)
    prediction head with only learned hyperedge repr.
    Epoch 8/15, Average Loss: 0.6670
    No better than random guessing. The aggregation of features
    over the node set is not very meaningful.
